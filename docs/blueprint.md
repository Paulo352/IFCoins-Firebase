## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to evoke a sense of calmness and reliability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) for a clean and institutional feel.
- Accent color: Soft orange (#FFB347) to highlight key interactive elements and CTAs, ensuring they stand out against the cooler primary and background.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that combines a modern look and a little warmth or personality; suitable for headlines or body text
- Use clear and recognizable icons for navigation in the sidebar and for representing card rarities. The style should align with the clean, institutional aesthetic, avoiding overly playful or complex designs.
- Employ a clean and structured layout with a sidebar for navigation and well-defined sections for different functionalities (shop, collection, trading). Cards should be displayed in a grid format, making it easy for users to browse.
- Subtle animations and transitions when cards are flipped, packs are opened, or trades are proposed. The goal is to add a touch of visual interest without overwhelming the user.
