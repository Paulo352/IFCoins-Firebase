/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the IFCoins application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of user-ownership and role-based access control (RBAC).
 * User-specific data is secured using path-based ownership (e.g., /users/{userId}).
 * Privileges (admin, teacher) are granted based on the user's role stored in their document in the /users collection.
 * This version simplifies rules to avoid "get-before-list" issues by allowing broader reads
 * on public/semi-public data and focusing restrictions on write operations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores personal user data, including their role.
 * - /cards/{cardId}: Stores card data, publicly readable. Admins/teachers can write.
 * - /packs/{packId}: Stores pack data, publicly readable. Admins can write.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event data, publicly readable. Admins can write.
 * - /trades/{tradeId}: Stores trade proposals between users.
 * - /rewards/{rewardId}: Log of rewards given by teachers/admins.
 * - /multipliers/{multiplierId}: Global coin multipliers, managed by admins.
 * - /users/{userId}/cards/{cardId}: A user's private card collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - The user's document in /users is the source of truth for their role.
 * - Write operations on core game data are restricted to teachers or admins.
 * - Listing all users is restricted to teachers and admins to protect privacy.
 * - Reading individual user profiles is allowed for any signed-in user to enable features like trades and rankings.
