/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the IFCoins application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control (RBAC) system using Firebase Auth Custom Claims.
 * User roles ('admin', 'teacher') are embedded directly in the user's authentication token,
 * which is the most secure and performant way to handle authorization in Firestore.
 * This approach completely avoids making `get()` calls in rules, which can lead to performance issues
 * and disallowed operations (like making a `get` call when evaluating a `list` rule).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user data. The user's role is NOT read from here for rules.
 * - /cards/{cardId}: Publicly readable card data. Writes are restricted to admins/teachers.
 * - /packs/{packId}: Publicly readable pack data. Writes are restricted to admins.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Publicly readable event data. Writes are restricted to admins.
 * - /trades/{tradeId}: Trade proposals between users.
 * - /rewards/{rewardId}: Log of rewards given by teachers/admins.
 * - /multipliers/{multiplierId}: Global coin multipliers, managed by admins.
 * - /users/{userId}/cards/{cardId}: A user's private card collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - The user's role is determined exclusively by the `role` custom claim in `request.auth.token`.
 * - This makes rule evaluation fast and secure, as it doesn't require extra database reads.
 * - Public data is readable by anyone, while sensitive write operations are protected by role checks.
 * - User-specific data (like their card collection) is protected by checking the user's UID.
