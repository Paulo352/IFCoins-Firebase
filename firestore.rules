/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the IFCoins application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control (RBAC) system.
 * User roles ('admin', 'teacher', 'student') are stored in their respective documents in the /users collection.
 * For rule evaluation, we read the user's role from their document. This is secure because
 * the rules for /users/{userId} prevent users from modifying their own 'role' field.
 *
 * Security Note on `get()` vs `exists()`:
 * Using `get()` to read a document within a rule counts towards your read quota and can impact performance
 * if used excessively. However, it's a standard and secure pattern for checking roles when custom claims
 * are not a viable option. It is NOT allowed in `list` rules.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user data, including their role.
 * - /cards/{cardId}: Publicly readable card data.
 * - /packs/{packId}: Publicly readable pack data.
 * - /events/{eventId}: Publicly readable event data.
 * - /trades/{tradeId}: Trade proposals between users.
 * - /rewards/{rewardId}: Log of rewards given by teachers/admins.
 * - /multipliers/{multiplierId}: Global coin multipliers.
 * - /users/{userId}/cards/{cardId}: A user's private card collection.
